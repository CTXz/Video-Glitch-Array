Here is a set of rules/standards that I should probably try to keep up when designing my circuits and PCBs...

PCBs:

  Traces:

    - Ensure mirrored traces are symmetrical

  Silkscreen:

    - Keep a 40mm spacing between reference designator and the components footprint Silkscreen
    - Keep a 70mm spacing between header descriptors and the header footprint Silkscreen
    - Use a 0.75mm text widht and height and 0.1mm thickness for header descriptors
    - Keep labels horizontally or vertically centered
